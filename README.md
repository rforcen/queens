# queens
The queens problem.  Solves any number of chess queens problem using three different approaches:      Combinatory: O(n^n) → slowest      Permutations: O(n!)      Tree optimized &lt; O(n!) → fastest  generation is performed using multi-thread, so all cores of CPU are used, for very large number of queens the ‘stop when found [n] solutions or more’ can be used, (0=all solutions)  Results can be saved to a text file or copied to clipboard (total or selection), board image can also be copied as an image.  Selected results can be transformed by translation, rotation or mirroring.  Window geometry, n queens, stop solutions and dock positions are stored in main settings.    It has been tested for n=34, providing the first solution in about 3 minutes on an 8 core i7 CPU.
